## Demystifying ML
## Final Project Requirements:
1. Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
2. Use ML in the context of technologies learned.
3. You must use: Scikit-Learn and/or another machine learning library.
4. You must use at least TWO of the following:
  - Python Pandas
  - Python Matplotlib
  - HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
  - JavaScript Plotly
  - JavaScript D3.js
  - JavaScript Leaflet
  - SQL Database
  - MongoDB Database
  - Google Cloud SQL
  - Amazon AWS
  - Tableau
5. Host application using Heroku or a tool of your choice
6. Prepare a 15-minute data deep-dive or infrastructure walkthrough that shows machine learning in the context of what we've already learned.
7. Example projects:
  - Create a front-end interface that maps to an API to "smarten" the algorithm.
  - Perform a deep dive of existing data using machine learning.
  - Create a visualization that continues to learn where clusters lie based on ML (Use D3 or Plotly to change the visualization).
  - Create an idea with mock data that stimulates how machine learning might be used.
  - Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression.
